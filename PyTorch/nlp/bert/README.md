The Demo script is a wrapper for respective python training scripts. Additional environment variables are used in training scripts in order to achieve optimal results for each workload.

# Setup
Please follow the instructions given in the following link for setting up the environment: [Gaudi Setup and Installation Guide](https://github.com/HabanaAI/Setup_and_Install). Please answer the questions in the guide according to your preferences. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your system to run the model on Gaudi.


## Pre-training dataset preparation

`Model-References/PyTorch/nlp/bert/pretraining/data` provides scripts to download, extract and preprocess [Wikipedia](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/) and [BookCorpus](http://yknzhu.wixsite.com/mbweb) datasets.
Install the required Python packages in the container:
```
 pip install -r Model-References/PyTorch/nlp/bert/pretraining/requirements.txt
```
Then, go to `data` folder and run the data preparation script.
```
cd Model-References/PyTorch/nlp/bert/pretraining/data
```
So it is recommended to download wiki data set alone using the following command.
```
bash create_datasets_from_start.sh
```
Wiki and BookCorpus data sets can be downloaded by runnining the script as follows.
```
bash create_datasets_from_start.sh wiki_books
```
Note that the pretraining dataset is huge and takes several hours to download. BookCorpus may have access and download constraints. The final accuracy may vary depending on the dataset and its size.
The script creates formatted dataset for the phase1 and 2 of pre-training.

## Fine-tuning dataset preparation

### MRPC dataset preparation
MRPC dataset can be downloaded using download_glue_data.py script. Download python script from the following link and run the script to download data into `glue_data` directory.
```
mkdir -p $HOME/datasets/glue_data
cd $HOME/datasets/
wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/W4ngatang/60c2bdb54d156a41194446737ce03e2e/raw/17b8dd0d724281ed7c3b2aeeda662b92809aadd5/download_glue_data.py
python download_glue_data.py --data_dir glue_data --tasks MRPC
```

### SQuADv1.1 dataset preparation
The data for SQuAD can be downloaded with the following links and should be saved into a directory. Specify path of the directory to demo script.
```
mkdir -p $HOME/datasets/Squad
cd $HOME/datasets/Squad
wget https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/dataset/train-v1.1.json
wget https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/dataset/dev-v1.1.json
wget https://github.com/allenai/bi-att-flow/blob/master/squad/evaluate-v1.1.py
```
The pre-trained model will be downloaded the first time the demo is launched provided access to Internet is guaranteed.

## Model Overview
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a technique for natural language processing (NLP) pre-training developed by Google.
The original English-language BERT model comes with two pre-trained general types: (1) the BERTBASE model, a 12-layer, 768-hidden, 12-heads, 110M parameter neural network architecture, and (2) the BERTLARGE model, a 24-layer, 1024-hidden, 16-heads, 340M parameter neural network architecture; both of which were trained on the BooksCorpus with 800M words, and a version of the English Wikipedia with 2,500M words.
The Pretraining modeling scripts are derived from a clone of https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples.git and the fine tuning is based on https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git.


# Pre-Training
- Located in: `Model-References/PyTorch/nlp/bert/pretraining`
- Suited for datasets:
  - `wiki`, `bookswiki`(combination of BooksCorpus and Wiki datasets)
- Uses optimizer: **LAMB** ("Layer-wise Adaptive Moments optimizer for Batch training").
- Consists of 2 phases:
  - Task 1 - **Masked Language Model** - where given a sentence, a randomly chosen word is guessed.
  - Task 2 - **Next Sentence Prediction** - where the model guesses whether sentence B comes after sentence A
- The resulting (trained) model weights are language-specific (here: english) and has to be further "fitted" to do a specific task (with finetuning).
- Heavy-weight: the training takes several hours or days.

BERT training script supports pre-training of  dataset on BERT large for both FP32 and BF16 mixed precision data type using **Graph and Lazy mode**.

## Reference Script
The base training and modeling scripts for pretraining are based on a clone of
https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples.

## Training the Model
Clone the Model-References git.
Set up the data set as mentioned in the section "Set up dataset".

```
cd Model-References/PyTorch/nlp/bert
```
Run `python demo_bert.py pretraining -h` for command-line options.

You can use Python launcher of `habana_model_runner.py` located in `Model-References/central` folder to
launch the training for the specified model.

i. graph mode, bf16 mixed precision, BS64 for phase1 and BS8 for phase2:
```

```
ii. graph mode, fp32 precision, BS32 for phase1 and BS4 for phase2:
```
python demo_bert.py pretraining --model_name_or_path large --mode graph --data_type fp32 --batch_size 32 4 --accumulate_gradients --allreduce_post_accumulation --allreduce_post_accumulation_fp16 --data_dir <dataset_path_phase1> <dataset_path_phase2>

```

## Multicard Training

Use the following commands to run multicard training on 8 cards:

i. graph mode, bf16 mixed precision, per chip batch size of 64 for phase1 and 8 for phase2:
```
python demo_bert.py pretraining --model_name_or_path large --mode graph --data_type bf16 --world_size 8 --batch_size 64 8 --accumulate_gradients --allreduce_post_accumulation --allreduce_post_accumulation_fp16 --dist --data_dir <dataset_path_phase1> <dataset_path_phase2>
```

```

# Fine Tuning
- Located in: `Model-References/PyTorch/nlp/bert/finetuning`
- Suited for tasks:
  - `mrpc`: Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (**MRPC**) is a paraphrase identification dataset, where systems aim to identify if two sentences are paraphrases of each other.
  - `squad`: Stanford Question Answering Dataset (**SQuAD**) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.
- Uses optimizer: **AdamW** ("ADAM with Weight Decay Regularization").
- Based on model weights trained with pretraining.
- Light-weight: the training takes a minute or so.
- Datasets for MRPC and SQuAD will be automatically downloaded the first time the model is run in the docker container.

The BERT demo uses training scripts and models from https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git (tag v3.0.2)
